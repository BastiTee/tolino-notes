# Tolino Notes

> Convert Tolino notes into useful formats

Tolino stores your highlights and notes in a `notes.txt` file on your device. However the format of that file is neither human- nor computer-readable. This project tries to close the gap by parsing the file (somehow) and convert it to a structured file â€“ one per book in your `notes.txt`.

How to get the file?

- Connect your Tolino to your computer via USB.
- Use a file manager (Finder or Explorer) and open the root directory of the device.
- Look for the `notes.txt` file.

## Install and use

Install using pip / poetry or similar [from PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tolino-notes/).

```shell
$ python -m pip install tolino-notes
```

In a new shell run:

```shell
$ tolino-notes --help
Usage: tolino-notes [OPTIONS]
